Project Objectives
This project is designed to accurately classify the types of Iris flowers found in various geographical regions of Turkey and to be used to predict the type of Iris flowers. Our main goals are:

Data Collection and Preparation: To collect, clean and make available data on Iris flowers across TÃ¼rkiye for analysis.
Model Development: Training on data using various machine learning models and determining the best performing model.
Accuracy and Performance: To maximize the accuracy rate of the selected model and provide high performance in predicting flower types.
Applied Research: To contribute to Turkey's biodiversity by evaluating the findings obtained within a scientific framework.
Education and Awareness Raising: To raise awareness in the field of biology and data science by using project results as educational materials.

By achieving these goals, to reveal the potential of data science and machine learning in biological research, to support advances in these fields, and to introduce these data to users in a more accurate and summarized form.
